    <p>Hi! We’re Bhanja and Sameek, two 7th graders who created our own proxy to help people browse the internet more safely. 
       We noticed that sometimes websites block content or track your every move online, and we wanted to find a way to keep things private.
       So, we worked together to build a simple proxy that helps hide your real location and keeps your online activity private. 
       Our goal is to help everyone browse the internet freely and safely, without worrying about privacy issues or restrictions. 
       We’re excited to share our project and hope it can make the internet a better place for everyone!
